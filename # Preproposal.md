# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I plan to model it after the website/app that Cher from the movie "Clueless" uses to pick out her
outfit in school. I will require inputs for what material and color the clothes are and then utilize 
online knowledge to test if the fabrics and the color schemes match to create a cohesive outfit

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Do you have any questions of your own?
